Exemplary Protein PBPK Models 



The file "protein_model_expamples.pksim5" contains two exemplary simulations using the protein model. 
They describe the PK of the antibody CDA1 (reported in C. P. Taylor et al. (2008), Vaccine, 26(27-28), 3404-3409) and a domain antibody (reported in A. Sepp et al. (2015), J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn, 42(2), 97-109). 

The simulations are also described in C. Niederalt et al.  (2018), J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 45 (2), 235–257.
