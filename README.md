Exemplary Protein PBPK Models 

## Repository files
The file "protein_model_expamples.pksim5" contains two exemplary simulations using the protein model. 
They describe the PK of the antibody CDA1 (reported in [C. P. Taylor et al. (2008), Vaccine, 26(27-28), 3404-3409](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18502001)) and a domain antibody (reported in [A. Sepp et al. (2015), J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn, 42(2), 97-109](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577033)). 

The simulations are also described in [C. Niederalt et al.  (2018), J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 45 (2), 235–257.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234936)

## Version information
The physiology is based on the PBPK model implemented in PK-Sim version 7.1.0. The PK-Sim project files were created in version 7.2.1.
